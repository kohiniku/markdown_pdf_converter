## Centralized port configuration for docker-compose
# Copy this file to `.env` at the project root to override defaults.
# docker-compose.yml uses these to set container and published ports.

# Backend (FastAPI/Uvicorn)
# BACKEND_INTERNAL_PORT=
# BACKEND_HOST_PORT=

# Frontend (React dev server)
# FRONTEND_INTERNAL_PORT=
# FRONTEND_HOST_PORT=

# Reverse proxy (Nginx published ports on host)
# NGINX_HTTP_PORT=
# NGINX_HTTPS_PORT=

# Nginx internal listen port (inside container)
# NGINX_INTERNAL_HTTP_PORT=

# Note: CORS and other settings are defined in docker-compose.yml using these vars.
#       Update those lines if you add hosts or change topology.
